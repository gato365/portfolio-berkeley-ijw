Question 3: Where is the info located?

Since the header URLs are going to be pointing to information on the website and the contact information is going to be linked to information off the website and finally the images are going to be linked to material that is on the website. It is important that we make that designation in the actual Website

Question 4: What type of tags will be used?

Answer 4: This image is actually very important because it allows me to figure out what tags are going to be needed within the HTML file before actually programming. I change my mind in terms of the article regarding the projects in the main projects so I decided to split them up into A,: Article 1, with 1 image

-A1: Article 1
-A2: Article 2
